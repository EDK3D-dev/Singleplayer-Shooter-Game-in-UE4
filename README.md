# About my participation

During the project I tried myself in different roles: gemr designer, game developer, level designer and tester. 

As a game designer. 
- planning
- developing gameplay concept
- addressing requirements

As a game developer.
- just a little work on mechanics with C++ (then moved to blueprints developing)

As a level designer.
- Lots of work searching the market for free assets (cos we had no 3D-artist)
- Making levels of those assets
- Work with blueprints, materials, meshes, textures, sounds, etc.

As a tester.
- Playing game prototypes
- Tracking bugs
